            "he coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already surpassed the combined mortality inflicted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002 and 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic of 2013. The pandemic is spreading at an exponential rate, with millions of people across the globe at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Initial reports suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent comorbidities in affected patients, and case fatality rates tended to be high in these individuals. In the largest Chinese study to date,1 which included 44 672 confirmed cases, preexisting comorbidities that had high mortality rates included cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6.0%). Patients with such comorbidities are commonly treated with renin angiotensin system blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19 or at risk of COVID-19 infection is currently a subject of intense debate. Below, we outline the mechanisms by which ACEIs/ARBs may be of benefit in those with COVID-19, what the current recommendations are for their use in infected patients, and suggested areas for further research.\n",

            "s we brace for the imminent impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we are faced with a controversy on how to best minimize the risk of lethal disease among the most vulnerable of us. Preliminary epidemiological data show an uneven-handed impact on the population, with an exponential increase in disease severity and mortality in those beyond the sixth decade of life with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Given that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme coopted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter epithelial cells, is upregulated in patients with CVD and diabetes treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), it was proposed that this increase in ACE2 expression underpins the greater COVID-19 severity in this population. This has created substantial controversy regarding the approach to patients taking ACEIs/ARBs in preparation for the pandemic, with some advocating for discontinuing these medications while expert opinions recommended against discontinuation, given the lack of strong evidence.1\n",

After a sample is collected, RNA, which is part of the virus particle, is extracted and converted to complementary DNA for testing. The PCR test involves binding sequences on the DNA that only are found in the virus and repeatedly copying everything in between. This process is repeated many times, with doubling of the target region with each cycle. A fluorescent signal is created when amplification occurs, and once the signal reaches a threshold, the test result is considered positive. If no viral sequence is present, amplification will not occur, resulting in a negative result.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100 000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities. Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.</p>\n",

            "n December 2019, a coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged from Wuhan, China. Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a public health emergency of international concern because of the global spread. As of March 2, 2020, there are 88 948 cases among 65 countries, including 3043 deaths.1 The spread has continued across all continents except Antarctica and is rapidly being identified in more and more states in the US.; While modes of viral transmission are still currently being researched, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular transmission.2 The RNA of SARS-CoV was previously identified in tears in 2003.3 Given the genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as well as the purported use of similar mechanisms to infect host cells, ocular shedding of viruses is a possibility that should be recognized by practicing ophthalmologists around the world.\n",

Current reports show that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1,2 and that it has a greater transmissibility than other coronaviruses. The confirmed transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 include respiratory droplets and physical contact, and the incubation period for the virus is approximately 3 to 7 days, but it can be as long as 24 days.3 In this case series, we report a cluster-spreading event in Huai’an (700 km northeast of Wuhan) in Jiangsu Province, China, in which a patient with SARS-CoV-2 may have transmitted the virus to 8 other healthy individuals via bathing in a public bath center.\n",

            "he recent report of 2 critically ill emergency physicians infected by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a sobering reminder of the vulnerability of the nation’s health care workforce.1 While all members of the health care workforce are vital as the health care system faces perhaps its greatest challenge in memory, physicians and nurses are the caregivers who typically have the most direct contact with patients, whether through advising, triaging, or treating those who require hospitalization.; Across the nation, people, and particularly those older than 60 years, are being asked to stay at home and practice social distancing to slow the spread of infection and help avoid overwhelming hospitals that are expected to encounter shortages of needed equipment and personnel. Recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the rates of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality among reported COVID-19 cases in the United States are substantially higher among patients older than 45 years compared with younger patients, with case-fatality rates exceeding 1.4% among patients aged 55 to 64 years and exceeding 2.7% among those aged 65 to 74 years.2\n",

She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.</p>\n",

As a medical community, we are actively engaged in a real-time data gathering mode to facilitate active learning and an expedited study of best practices of care. Although we are becoming more aware of the natural history of COVID-19, we have had scant information as of yet that addresses any unique risks of COVID-19 for those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Such information is of paramount importance as we now must begin to consider the potential for direct and indirect adverse effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the heart and especially so in those with already established heart disease.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels.</p><h3>Result</h3><p>Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530,<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613,<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (<i>P</i> = .001;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (<i>P</i> = .96;<i>P</i> = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.</p>\n",

            "he novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging health care systems worldwide and raising important ethical issues, especially regarding the potential need for rationing health care in the context of scarce resources and crisis capacity. Even if capacity to provide care is sufficient, one priority should be addressing goals of care in the setting of acute life-threatening illness, especially for patients with chronic, life-limiting disease.; Clinicians should ensure patients receive the care they want, aligning the care that is delivered with patients’ values and goals. The importance of goal-concordant care is not new or even substantially different in the context of this pandemic, but the importance of providing goal-concordant care is now heightened in several ways. Patients most likely to develop severe illness will be older and have greater burden of chronic illness—exactly those who may wish to forgo prolonged life support and who may find their quality of life unacceptable after prolonged life support.1 In addition, recent reports suggest that survival may be substantially lower when acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with COVID-19 vs when it is associated with other etiologies.2,3\n",

As of March 2020, ClinicalTrials.gov listed 262 366 ongoing randomized clinical trials, including 146 420 trials studying drug or biologic interventions, 85 045 trials of behavioral interventions, and 61 351 trials of surgical or device interventions.1 Suddenly, and quite dramatically, the coronavirus pandemic threatens the integrity of these clinical trials. The National Institutes of Health has advised investigators to consult with their institutional review boards and institutions about potential measures to protect participants and research staff. Responses from academic medical center and other research groups have varied from mandatory suspension of research involving human participants (except when this increases risk to participants) to relying on principal investigator discretion.\n",

Neither the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus ([H1N1]pdm09) pandemic or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics had the combination of both high transmissibility and severity. Control strategies are driven by this combination. R0, the basic reproduction number, is a commonly used measure of transmissibility and is defined as the number of additional persons one case infects over the course of their illness. An R0 of less than 1 indicates the infection will die out “eventually.” An R0 of greater than 1 indicates the infection has the potential for sustained transmission.\n",

State and local public health emergency declarations are also likely. During crises, government has a special responsibility to thoughtfully balance public health protections and civil liberties.; While epidemiological data are evolving, human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 has been documented over an incubation period of 2 to 14 days.2 Based on available data, the case fatality rate appears lower than that associated with other novel coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), likely no more than 2%. China has reported the majority of cases and deaths, especially in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province. The US population currently is at low risk, but infections could escalate if sustained transmission occurs. Absent rapid diagnostic tests, effective vaccines, or antiviral medications, health officials are focused on identifying cases and separating persons exposed or infected.\n",

Due to the high contagiousness of COVID-19 and the current lack of any effective vaccine or drug, scientists and physicians are conducting a series of clinical studies involving affected patients. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published “Guidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease”2 to ensure the scientific validity of and participants’ rights and safety in studies conducted during outbreaks. The guidance stated that there is a moral obligation to conduct timely scientific research. The Ethics Committee of the Henan Provincial People’s Hospital reviewed the COVID-19 studies from the hospital based on those guidelines.\n",

            "he 1918 influenza pandemic affected one-third of the world’s population and resulted in 50 million deaths. One hundred years ago, medical therapies and countermeasures were significantly limited, and information exchange that could facilitate any public health intervention primarily occurred by telephone, mail, or person-to-person interaction.; Now, more than a century later, a novel coronavirus is the cause of a new global pandemic threatening millions of lives.1 Today, many methods of sharing information have been subsumed by giant social media platforms that have incredible speed, reach, and penetration. More than 2.9 billion individuals use social media regularly, and many for long stretches of time.2\n",

            "cross the world, Dr Li Wenliang, MMed, has become the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China. The ophthalmologist, who tried to alert his colleagues to this novel coronavirus and subsequently became an early victim of the disease, was among many thousands of health care workers who continue to struggle with limited resources to treat patients with COVID-19 while staving off an even larger pandemic. Lai et al1 describe another ongoing struggle at the COVID-19 epicenter, namely its consequences on the mental health of clinicians and other health care workers.; Surveying more than 1200 nurses and physicians in 34 hospitals in the Wuhan region and across mainland China, the authors found striking prevalence rates of symptoms of depression and anxiety; half of those responding identified at least mild depression on a validated screening instrument, and one-third reported insomnia. Approximately 14% of physicians and nearly 16% of nurses described moderate or severe depressive symptoms. Those at greatest risk for depressive and anxious symptoms included women, those with intermediate seniority titles (compared with those with junior roles), and those at the center of the epidemic in Wuhan. These findings, consistent with those observed in the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic,2 may help to guide strategies for responding to mental health sequelae of this and future epidemics.\n",

Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0];<i>P</i> = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88;<i>P</i> = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09;<i>P</i> = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04;<i>P</i> &lt; .001).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.</p>\n",

A total of 28 130 cases in mainland China and 22 cases in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been confirmed as of February 6, 2020, with a reported epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days.1 The early reported mortality rate of 4.3%2 appears to be lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but this initial figure is believed likely to be an underestimation, as most of the confirmed patients are still inpatients, and their condition is not yet resolved.\n",

By December 31 the World Health Organization (WHO) regional office in Beijing had received notification of a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause from the same city.1 Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in central China, is the nation’s seventh largest city, with a population of 11 million people. Over the next few days, researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology performed metagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing from a sample collected from a bronchoalveolar lavage and identified a novel coronavirus as the potential etiology.

The etiology of these infections was a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),1,2 possibly connected to zoonotic or environmental exposure from the seafood market in Wuhan. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections, including among health care workers.3,4 The virus has spread to different parts of China and at least 26 other countries.1 A high number of men have been infected, and the reported mortality rate has been approximately 2%, which is lower than that reported from other coronavirus epidemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; mortality rate, >40% in patients aged >60 years)5 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; mortality rate, 30%).6 However, little is known about the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV in healthy populations or cases outside Wuhan.

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>Documented NCIP.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.</p>\n",

In the next 24 hours there were 36 more cases, none of whom had contact with the first patient or with anyone known to have COVID-19. This was the beginning of one of the largest and most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world. Despite aggressive containment efforts, the disease continues to spread and the number of affected patients is rising. The case-fatality rate has been very high and is dominated by very old patients.

            "Full body : The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) news coming from Italy should be sobering to health system leaders throughout the world. We are witnessing an advanced health system stretched beyond its capacity. When the capacity of the system is exceeded, rationing decisions may need to be made that extend well beyond patients with COVID-19. On March 11, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care was forced to publish guidelines for rationing care. Infectious disease and epidemiology experts1 have been outlining the worst-case scenarios possible with the unchecked spread of a novel virus, both in terms of immunity and preparedness. Unfortunately, hospital systems are designed for average patient loads, not epidemics. Observations from Italy demonstrate what is at stake. When containment fails, the exponential growth of cases can transform a public health emergency into an operational crisis.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.</p>\n",

            "new viral illness called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in China in December 2019.; Lessons learned from China and similar viral diseases can help families prepare for spread in the US. How children in the US will be affected is still mostly unknown. So far, proportionately fewer children have gotten sick in China, and the effects on them have mostly been mild. It is important for families to prepare for spread in the US.; COVID-19 appears to be spread via respiratory secretions when infected people cough or sneeze, similar to how influenza (flu) spreads. Currently, people at risk for COVID-19 include those who have been in close contact with infected people within 14 days before their symptoms began. The average time from when persons are exposed to signs of illness is about 5 days and can range from 2 to 14 days. People with COVID-19 have fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, and diarrhea, which are all symptoms similar to other viral infections, such as the flu. People who need hospitalization usually have severe pneumonia. Currently, there are no treatments or vaccines available.\n",

            "ontroversies over diagnostic testing have dominated US headlines about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Technical challenges with the first test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) left the nation with minimal diagnostic capacity during the first few weeks of the epidemic. The CDC also initially limited access to testing to a narrow group of individuals with known exposure. The delayed discovery of a case of COVID-19 in California, followed quickly by evidence of community transmission in multiple states, revealed the shortcomings of this strategy. In the early stages, COVID-19 has spread beyond the nation’s ability to detect it.\n",

            "n December 31, 2019, China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated 2019-nCoV. Mounting cases and deaths pose major public health and governance challenges. China’s imposition of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire (a guarded area preventing anyone from leaving) in Hubei Province has also sparked controversy concerning its implementation and effectiveness. Cases have now spread to at least 4 continents. As of January 28, there are more than 4500 confirmed cases (98% in China) and more than 100 deaths.1 In this Viewpoint, we describe the current status of 2019-nCoV, assess the response, and offer proposals for strategies to bring the outbreak under control.\n",

We identified all infected infants in China and described demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical features.; For this retrospective study, we identified all hospitalized infants diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 6, 2020, in China. The summary number and geographic location of new COVID-19 infections, released daily by the central government, were screened to identify infants (aged 28 days to 1 year). Demographic information, including age, sex, and geographic location, released anonymously by local health departments, were then retrieved and local hospitals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were contacted for demographic data, family clustering (≥1 infected family member residing with the infant), linkage to Wuhan (residing in or visiting Wuhan or contact with visitors from Wuhan ≤2 weeks before the onset of infection), clinical features (symptoms at admission, dates of admission and diagnosis), treatment (intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation), prognosis (any severe complications, including death), and discharge date. Efforts were made to reach families of patients to confirm the information.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>The rapidly expanding novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has challenged the medical community to an unprecedented degree. Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists–head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub>&lt;300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub>, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub>increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.</p>\n",

The median age of those with confirmed infection is 50 years and the male-female ratio among cases is 1.6 to 1. Most reported cases have involved severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, but in 21% of the infections, patients have had mild or no symptoms. The number of contacts infected by people with confirmed infections appears to be limited.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years;<i>P</i> &lt; .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/μL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase–myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] μg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs &lt;0.006 [&lt;0.006-0.009] μg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%];<i>P</i> = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%];<i>P</i> = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%];<i>P</i> = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality.</p>\n",

            "Full body : To the Editor: A novel coronavirus has been identified as the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),1-3 for which there is no specific treatment. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNAs that direct sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in mammalian cells.4 It is also possible, however, that siRNAs could specifically interfere with viral RNA.; Methods; We designed six 21-mer SARSis (siRNAs [GENSET SA Ltd, Paris, France] targeting different sites of the replicase 1A region of the SARS coronavirus [SARS-CoV] genome; siRNA sequences in the senses strands: GUGAACUCACUCGUGAGCUCdTdT [SARSi-1]; GUACCCUCUUGAUUGCAUCdTdT [SARSi-2]; GAGUCGAAGAGAGGUGUCUdTdT [SARSi-3]; GCACUUGUCUACCUUGAUGdTdT [SARSi-4]; CCUCCAGAUGAGGAAGAAGdTdT [SARSi-5]; and GGUGUUUCCAUUCCAUGUGdTdT [SARSi-6]). We then performed 3 in vitro experiments to test their antiviral effects. In the first, we transfected monkey kidney cells (FRhk-4) with 1 of the 6 siRNAs. In addition to these 6 groups of cells, we also created 2 groups of control cells—1 transfected with an unrelated siRNA targeting luciferase (GL2i),5 and the other with the medium. OligoFectamine (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, Calif) was the transfection reagent. All groups of cells were incubated for 8 hours before infection with SARS virus GZ50 strain. Thirty-six hours after viral infection, cytopathic effects were judged with phase-contrast microscopy. The cells were then fixed with –20°C ethanol for 10 minutes and immunostained with a SARS-CoV–specific antibody isolated from acute covalent sera of confirmed SARS patients. The coronavirus antigens were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay using a fluoroscein isothiocyanate–coagulated antibody1,2 (Inova Diagnostic Inc, San Diego, Calif). To quantify the viral genomic RNA, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed as described previously.2\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Background</h3><p>The March 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. Muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are commonly encountered in patients with SARS. However, the nature and cause of myopathy associated with a SARS infection are unknown because, to our knowledge, there has been no report of histological or postmortem examination of the skeletal muscle from SARS-infected patients.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To determine the exact nature of the myopathy associated with SARS.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>Postmortem skeletal muscles from 8 consecutive patients who died of SARS in March 2003 were studied under light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Focal myofiber necrosis was identified in 4 of 8 cases. Macrophage infiltration and regenerative fiber were scanty. All 4 patients treated with a steroid had significant myofiber atrophy. In situ hybridization for coronavirus was negative in all subjects. Viral cultures for coronavirus and examination for viral particles under electron microscopy were performed in 2 patients. The viral culture yielded no organisms and there were no viral particles seen on electron microscopic examination.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>There is a spectrum of myopathic changes associated with a SARS infection. Focal myofiber necrosis is common and possibly is immune mediated. Critical illness myopathy and superimposed steroid myopathy may also play an important role in SARS.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Context</h3>Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in sub-Saharan Africa. Comparative estimates of the contribution of causative pathogens to the burden of disease are essential for targeted vaccine development.<h3>Objective</h3>To determine the viral etiology of severe pneumonia among infants and children at a rural Kenyan hospital using comprehensive and sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques.<h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3>Prospective observational and case-control study during 2007 in a rural Kenyan district hospital. Participants were children aged 1 day to 12 years, residing in a systematically enumerated catchment area, and who either were admitted to Kilifi District Hospital meeting World Health Organization clinical criteria for severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia; (2) presented with mild upper respiratory tract infection but were not admitted; or (3) were well infants and children attending for immunization.<h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3>The presence of respiratory viruses and the odds ratio for admission with severe disease.<h3>Results</h3>Of 922 eligible admitted patients, 759 were sampled (82% [median age, 9 months]). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425 of the 759 sampled (56% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 52%-60%]). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 260 participants (34% [95% CI, 31%-38%]) and other respiratory viruses were detected in 219 participants (29%; 95% CI, 26%-32%), the most common being Human coronavirus 229E (n = 51 [6.7%]), influenza type A (n = 44 [5.8%]), Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 29 [3.8%]), Human adenovirus (n = 29 [3.8%]), and Human metapneumovirus (n = 23 [3.0%]). Compared with well control participants, detection of RSV was associated with severe disease (5% in control participants; adjusted odds ratio, 6.11 [95% CI, 1.65-22.6]) while collectively, other respiratory viruses were not associated with severe disease (23% in control participants; adjusted odds ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.64-2.52]).<h3>Conclusion</h3>In a sample of Kenyan infants and children admitted with severe pneumonia to a rural hospital, RSV was the predominant viral pathogen.\n",

SARS-CoV-2 is a type of coronavirus, which is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe infections in humans.; COVID-19 causes a variety of symptoms in people who are infected, and not all people infected with COVID-19 will have the same symptoms. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, or body aches are some of the most common symptoms; however, some people have experienced headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sore throat as well. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 14 days after exposure, although some patients may not develop symptoms until later.\n",

Thus, the incidence of community transmission by persons with mild illness and without risk factors remains ill-defined.; The current public health strategy of case containment is premised on the assumption of no or limited community transmission. Identifying a high rate of community transmission would indicate a need to shift the public health strategy from containment to mitigation of spread. Thus, determining the rate at which mild disease is spreading in the community, particularly among persons without risk factors for acquisition of the virus, is critically important.\n",

Investigation consisted of local examination of ear, nose, and throat fields; palpation of the nuchal areas; and plain chest radiography. Analyses of throat swab samples using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction were conducted.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Clinical manifestations included fever in 31 patients (97%), followed by cough, dyspnea, chill, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, and otalgia. Neither the pharyngeal wall nor the tonsillar area demonstrated hyperemia. There was no lymphadenopathy in the neck. Plain chest radiographs revealed consolidation in 25 (78%) of 32 patients. Results of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting the novel coronavirus present in throat swab samples were positive in 19 (66%) of 29 patients tested. Twenty-eight patients required supplemental oxygen, and 14 patients were intubated with mechanical ventilation. Twenty-eight patients survived and 4 patients died.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>When presented with a patient with flulike symptoms such as fever and/or cough, but no pharyngeal hyperemia or neck lymphadenopathy, physicians should be alerted to the possibility of SARS. In contrast, evidence of inflammatory signs in the otolaryngological field may explain the flulike symptoms, and serve as a differential diagnostic tool between influenza and SARS.</p>\n",

            "ince January 1, 2020, JAMA and the JAMA Network journals have received hundreds of manuscripts and direct queries related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including research reports, case series and case reports, and opinion pieces. The editors have become aware that some of the patients described in some of these manuscripts, sometimes with overlapping authorship, have been reported in more than 1 submission. This inclusion of the same patients in more than 1 report has not been clearly indicated in the submitted manuscripts. This is of concern and may represent a lapse in ethical standards of scientific reporting.1; Reporting of the same patients in different articles (without clear indication of the duplicate reporting) creates an inaccurate scientific record, may affect the accuracy of subsequent estimates of prevalence of the disease or outcomes, and may preclude valid meta-analyses, unless authors of the meta-analyses are able to obtain individual patient data to ensure that patients are not being counted more than once in any publication.\n",

            "he coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will present an unprecedented stressor to patients and health care systems across the globe. Because there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the underlying infection, current health efforts are focused on providing prevention and screening, maintaining continuity of treatment for other chronic conditions, and ensuring access to appropriately intensive services for those with the most severe symptoms.1; Disasters disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with serious mental illness may be among the hardest hit. High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population.\n",

            "iruses have always been part of the human experience, most often in a delicate balance, otherwise the virus and its human host would become extinct. But this relationship is not particularly stable. Like all living substances, viruses mutate, sometimes in ways that cause explosive, severe disease. Viral outbreaks have killed off virtually entire populations, as happened when measles was first introduced into the previously naive population of the Faroe Islands, or when Europeans brought smallpox to North America. Humankind, as a whole, has survived evolving viral threats by evolving with them; prior exposure to related viruses produces varying degrees of resistance (immunity) to new strains. Humans with less resistance die, often despite modern medical intervention, while others remain entirely asymptomatic. Medical interventions (principally vaccines) and stringent public health measures have often altered the outcome, but not necessarily in predictable ways.\n",

Approximately 5% to 10% of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation.1; The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has previously published a series of guidelines for sepsis and septic shock. Based on this experience, experts were recruited to write guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill adults. These guidelines were authored by 36 experts from 12 countries (Table).2 Recommendations were developed based on limited direct evidence with COVID-19 cases and indirect evidence derived from previous pandemics such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other coronavirus infections. Overall, the panel issued 54 statements: 4 best practice statements, 9 strong recommendations, and 35 weak recommendations. (No recommendations were made for the remaining 6 topics.)\n",

Although the necessary focus has been to care for patients and communities, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has disrupted medical education and requires intense and prompt attention from medical educators. The need to prepare future physicians has never been as focused as it is now in the setting of a global emergency. The profound effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may forever change how future physicians are educated.; This pandemic presents practical and logistical challenges and concerns for patient safety, recognizing that students may potentially spread the virus when asymptomatic and may acquire the virus in the course of training. This Viewpoint discusses the current status of medical education, describes how COVID-19 may affect preclerkship and clerkship learning environments, and explores potential implications of COVID-19 for the future of medical education.\n",

            "he outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has rapidly spread to more than 58 countries and areas.1 As of March 1, 2020, about 79 968 cases in mainland China have been confirmed and 2873 deaths have occurred.1 The Chinese government is mustering medical personnel around the country to treat patients in Hubei province and preventing further spread of COVID-19 in every region of the country.; At the same time, several studies concerning the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 have been published in a timely manner, which has greatly helped health care workers and policy makers to understand COVID-19. Reading these reports, we noticed that many patients with COVID-19 had comorbid chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which collectively represent the most common noncommunicable epidemic in China currently. Among 44 672 individuals confirmed to have COVID-19 as of February 11, 2020, 2683 patients (12.8%) had hypertension and 873 (4.2%) had CVDs,2 which were the most common coexisting conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.3,4 Furthermore, patients with comorbid CVDs were more likely to have severe illness associated with COVID-19 and had a much higher fatality rate: 10.5% for those with CVDs and 6.0% for hypertension, while the fatality rate was 0.9% in patients who reported no comorbid conditions.2 This information indicated that individuals with underlying chronic CVDs were both more susceptible to COVID-19 and more prone to critical conditions and death. It is well known that acute pulmonary infection can potentially destabilize cardiac diseases, such as heart failure and coronary artery disease. Then deterioration of cardiac diseases would exacerbate COVID-19 management in turn.\n",

He had a history of atypical pneumonia that was not responding to treatment, but he was not considered at risk for COVID-19 infection.1 The positive result was immediately reported to the Lombardy health care system and governmental offices. During the next 24 hours, the number of reported positive cases increased to 36. This situation was considered a serious development for several reasons: the patient (“patient 1”) was healthy and young; in less than 24 hours, 36 additional cases were identified, without links to patient 1 or previously identified positive cases already in the country; it was not possible to identify with certainty the source of transmission to patient 1 at the time; and, because patient 1 was in the ICU and there were already 36 cases by day 2, chances were that a cluster of unknown magnitude was present and additional spread was likely.\n",

            "ecently, an outbreak of the highly infectious novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept Wuhan, China, with 80 303 confirmed diagnosed cases in China as of March 3, 2020.1 Considering its high risk of person-to-person transmission, hospitals, especially in China, are the typical congregating places that will bear the brunt of this infectious disease. To reduce or avoid cross infection of COVID-19, many hospitals have started taking actions to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatient admissions. For example, only emergency surgeries can be guaranteed, while most others are postponed. Maintenance chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy treatments for patients with advanced cancer are often suspended. However, forced delays or interruptions of routine treatment might increase the risk of disease deterioration, especially for patients with cancer. In China, approximately 4.3 million cases of cancer are diagnosed each year.2 During the epidemic of COVID-19, the treatment of patients with cancer, which is often considered as nonemergent, is inevitably affected across China, especially in Wuhan.\n",

It is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission from droplet contamination.1,2 A report of 138 hospitalized patients from a single institution (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University) indicated that hospital-acquired transmission accounted for 41.3% of these admitted patients, thus implicating the hospital environment as a source of spread of the virus.3 Patients with cancer are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and monitoring, and hence, they may be at risk of contracting COVID-19. Moreover, cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. Here, we report the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients who were treated at a tertiary cancer institution in Wuhan.\n",

            "Full body : As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads globally, signs are emerging that countries, including the United States, were woefully unprepared to protect health care personnel (HCP)—and thus, patients and the public. This lack of preparedness is shocking in light of the inevitability that a new global pandemic would emerge and the availability of guidance from the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic and the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak.; On February 26, 2020, the New York Times reported that nurses and other female health care workers in Wuhan, China, were encouraged to shave their heads, ostensibly for hygienic purposes. State media referred to them as “the most beautiful warriors” in the war against SARS-CoV-2. A prior report noted that physicians, nurses, and other HCP had reused damaged masks. An estimated 3300 HCP were infected and 22 died in China because of “insufficient protective equipment.”\n",

One stark example is the debate over whether to prescribe available therapies, such as quinine-based antimalarial drugs (eg, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine), or test these drugs in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). At the heart of the problem is one of the oldest dilemmas in human organizations: the “exploitation-exploration” trade-off.1 Exploitation refers to acting on current knowledge, habits, or beliefs despite uncertainty. This is the “just do it” option: give various therapies (eg, chloroquine) to affected patients based on current knowledge or a hunch. Exploration refers to actions taken to generate new knowledge and reduce uncertainty, eg, testing therapies in an RCT. This is the “must learn” option.\n",

While researchers race to develop vaccines, officials are implementing physical distancing, including orders to stay at home, restricting travel, and closing nonessential businesses (see eFigure in the Supplement). To limit cross-border spread, more than a dozen states have issued mandatory quarantines for interstate travelers. Some models suggest physical distancing would have to persist for 3 months to mitigate the peak effects on health systems and could be required on an intermittent basis for 12 to 18 months.1 What legal powers do governments have?

            "n late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained cases of viral pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China.1 This initial cluster of patients with what soon became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralded the arrival of a new pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, close to 90 000 cases have occurred in more than 60 countries with approximately 3000 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared these events a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.; It is expected that a COVID-19 vaccine will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture, and even then it may not be effective. Therapeutics might be developed much more quickly, with clinical trials already under way, but it is too soon to know when such therapies might be available. There are still many uncertainties regarding COVID-19, including the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases in China and other countries, the overall attack rate in the population, and the ultimate case-fatality rate in different countries around the world.\n",

            "n the 2014 Ebola outbreak, close to 30 000 individuals developed Ebola viral disease (EVD), and numerous therapies were tested against this virus, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, brincidofovir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, and convalescent plasma, among many others. With such a large number of therapeutic interventions given to affected patients, the goal was to determine which was efficacious against Ebola. Ultimately, none proved to be efficacious or safe.; Why were new therapies not discovered? One reason is because virtually all studies were single-group interventions without concurrent controls, which led to no definitive conclusion related to efficacy or safety. Despite much resistance and controversy regarding asking patients with EVD to participate in a randomized clinical trial (RCT),1 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted the first and only RCT during that outbreak. It took several months to design the trial, but it was implemented and successfully launched during the outbreak; however, it was too late for the RCT to be completed.2 This tragedy of not discovering new therapies during an outbreak cannot be repeated.\n",

All infants also had elevated IgG antibody values and cytokine levels, although these may have crossed the placenta from the mother to the infant. No infant specimen had a positive reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test result, so there is not virologic evidence for congenital infection in these cases to support the serologic suggestion of in utero transmission. Nevertheless, the serologic data are provocative for a virus that is believed to be spread by respiratory secretions and—given the modeling showing that a significant percentage of the world’s population, many of them pregnant women, will be infected over the next weeks or months—it is one that deserves careful consideration. However, at this time, these data are not conclusive and do not prove in utero transmission.\n",

Worldwide, more than 100 000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) and more than 3500 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is thought to have higher mortality than seasonal influenza, even as wide variation is reported. While the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates global mortality at 3.4%, South Korea has noted mortality of about 0.6%.1-3; Vaccine development and research into medical treatment for COVID-19 are under way, but are many months away. Meanwhile, the pressure on the global health care workforce continues to intensify. This pressure takes 2 forms. The first is the potentially overwhelming burden of illnesses that stresses health system capacity and the second is the adverse effects on health care workers, including the risk of infection.\n",

In China, patients with COVID-19 were immediately isolated in designated existing hospitals, and new hospitals were rapidly built to manage the increasing numbers of cases in the most affected areas. Home quarantine for contacts was initiated and large gatherings were canceled. Additionally, community containment for approximately 40 million to 60 million residents was instituted. A significant positive association between the incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality was apparent in the Chinese response.3 That is, the rapid escalation in the number of infections in China had resulted in insufficient health care resources, followed by an increase in mortality.\n",

In addition, 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were evacuated on February 5 to a US Air Force base in California following exposure on a cruise ship. These patients, who were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, were transferred to local hospitals using a containment strategy.3 When a small number of infected patients are in concentrated locales, containment strategies (ie, quarantine) can halt the spread of infection by isolating infected or exposed individuals from the general population.4 However, disease containment requires the use of airborne isolation rooms, personal protective and other disposable equipment, and significant numbers of health care personnel. As COVID-19 spreads both in the US and around the world, it may not be possible to care for all patients in this manner.\n",

It is not uncommon for care teams to decide against initiating or continuing mechanical ventilation when such treatment would not achieve a patient’s goals or directives. COVID-19 presents a different case: patients who do not receive a ventilator could benefit, perhaps living for many additional years, if they receive short-term mechanical ventilation. Denying patients such treatment, against their wishes, most likely will result in their death, but it will also make this scarce resource available to other patients who are more likely to survive if they receive ventilator support.\n",

            "Full body : As the world grapples with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), experts have called for increased access to health care resources, including diagnostic testing, particularly in light of the recent expansion of the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authority to make such testing more widely available in the United States.1 Despite rapid expansion, there are significant barriers to testing in ambulatory clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals, which are likely to see a substantial increase in demand. Such access points also pose risks due to overcrowding and nosocomial transmission.; Current policy solutions are trying to eliminate financial barriers as well as facilitate additional points of access through increased use of telemedicine. However, telemedicine itself has limitations, because patients still need to go to a health facility to have a specimen collected and sent for processing.\n",

            "s the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accelerates, global health care systems have become overwhelmed with potentially infectious patients seeking testing and care. Preventing spread of infection to and from health care workers (HCWs) and patients relies on effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE)—gloves, face masks, air-purifying respirators, goggles, face shields, respirators, and gowns. A critical shortage of all of these is projected to develop or has already developed in areas of high demand. PPE, formerly ubiquitous and disposable in the hospital environment, is now a scarce and precious commodity in many locations when it is needed most to care for highly infectious patients. An increase in PPE supply in response to this new demand will require a large increase in PPE manufacturing, a process that will take time many health care systems do not have, given the rapid increase in ill COVID-19 patients.\n",

For example, blood donors must be in good health and have a normal temperature on the day of donation,” the agency noted. “As communities are affected, it is imperative that healthy individuals continue to donate blood.”\n",

Medicaid, which covers 71 million individuals, has an important responsibility in addressing these gaps. Medicaid programs can fund unexpected health care services that other insurance plans may exclude and are thus well-positioned to ensure that vulnerable patients have access to important health care services, and that hospitals and other health care organizations and clinicians are reimbursed for providing that care.; States can take several actions to waive federal or state requirements to accomplish the following goals: (1) improving prompt testing and treatment of patients with COVID-19, (2) mitigating the strain on the health care system and preserving capacity of hospitals and health care practitioners, and (3) limiting transmission of COVID-19 by facilitating changes in how care is delivered. Through the series of actions outlined below, Medicaid programs should have a key role in protecting enrollees, supporting public health efforts to reduce spread of the virus, and aiding the health care system to increase capacity.\n",

Unprecedented containment and mitigation policies have been implemented in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, screening and testing of travelers, isolation and quarantine, and school closures.; A key goal of such policies is to decrease the encounters between infected individuals and susceptible individuals and decelerate the rate of transmission. Although such social distancing strategies are critical in the current time of pandemic, it may seem surprising that the current understanding of the routes of host-to-host transmission in respiratory infectious diseases are predicated on a model of disease transmission developed in the 1930s that, by modern standards, seems overly simplified. Implementing public health recommendations based on these older models may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions.\n",

The particularly infectious capacity of the virus, along with mortality rates ranging from 1% to above 5%, has raised concerns across the globe.1 Older patients with comorbid conditions including pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension have been associated with even higher mortality rates, suggesting particularly susceptible populations.; The increased mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension is an association that has been observed in a number of initial epidemiological studies outlining the characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Wu et al2 found hypertension to have a hazard ratio of 1.70 for death and 1.82 for acute respiratory distress syndrome in 201 patients with COVID-19. Zhou et al3 found hypertension to have a hazard ratio of 3.05 for in-hospital mortality in 191 patients with COVID-19.\n",

            "Full body : As New Yorkers and public health practitioners, we’ve observed many health- and non-health-related emergencies that have affected our city during the past 2 decades, including 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, and COVID-19. These experiences have prepared us to share innovative strategies to address challenges related to food access during an emergency. In this article, we propose expanding the reach and strengthening the infrastructure of online grocery shopping and meal delivery services to provide swift support for vulnerable groups during a public health crisis.; During emergencies, everyone has a right to a sufficient supply of food, yet individuals with low income and older adults may face unique challenges. Both groups may have fixed incomes, which makes it incredibly difficult to stockpile food as a precautionary measure, and strategies to prevent transmission, such as ordering groceries online, may not be affordable, feasible, or even accessible for these individuals. For example, curbside pickup is often cheaper than home delivery, but it still costs extra. Addressing food insecurity during an emergency, therefore, becomes a matter of health equity and, in the case of COVID-19, a critical strategy to reduce transmission.\n",

As of March 21, 2020, there have been 275 434 cases confirmed globally, including 11 399 deaths.1 While the situation in China has improved, many countries continue to struggle with escalating case numbers and strained health care systems that are threatened to be overwhelmed by the pandemic.; One of the World Health Organization’s strategic priorities is to limit human-to-human transmission, including secondary infections among health care workers, which was a key feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and accounted for one-fifth of all cases globally. Although SARS and COVID-19 are both transmitted by droplets, it is now clear that the infectivity and extent of spread of COVID-19 will far exceed that of SARS.\n",

In ordinary clinical circumstances, all patients in need of mechanical ventilation because of potentially-reversible conditions receive it, unless they or their surrogates decline. However, there are mounting concerns in many countries that this will not be possible and that patients who otherwise would likely survive if they received ventilator support will die because no ventilator is available. In this type of public health emergency, the ethical obligation of physicians to prioritize the well-being of individual patients may be overridden by public health policies that prioritize doing the greatest good for the greatest number of patients.1 These circumstances raise a critical question: when demand for ventilators and other intensive treatments far outstrips the supply, what criteria should guide these rationing decisions?\n",

Four patients without coexisting diseases received convalescent plasma around hospital day 20, and a patient with hypertension and mitral valve insufficiency received the plasma transfusion at day 10. The donor plasma had demonstrable IgG and IgM anti–SARS-CoV-19 antibodies and neutralized the virus in in vitro cultures. Although these patients continued to receive antiviral treatment primarily with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, the use of convalescent plasma may have contributed to their recovery because the clinical status of all patients had improvement approximately 1 week after transfusion, as evidenced by normalization of body temperature as well as improvements in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and Pao2/Fio2 ratio. In addition, the patients’ neutralizing antibody titers increased and respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 and 12 days after transfusion.\n",

            "Full body : Guidelines are developed for various reasons, including the emergence of new, potentially practice-changing evidence or a perceived need for guidance in times of uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an almost unparalleled example of the latter, prompting the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Task Force to rapidly produce Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).1 These guidelines are adapted from the well-known 2016 SSC guidelines,2 and highlights are excerpted in this issue of JAMA.3 In a brief amount of time, the authors have produced an impressively thorough and expansive set of guidelines, organized as more than 50 recommendations under 4 domains. The intended goal is to reduce unwanted practice variation and provide a focused and informed distillation of the existing evidence in a manner that will be practical for, and accessible to, clinicians in a wide variety of settings around the world. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, the SSC Task Force relied on the expert interpretation of available evidence from analogous conditions, such as sepsis, when generating its recommendation. The intent of the guideline committee is to update the guidelines as evidence specific to the care of patients with COVID-19 emerges.\n",

            "Full body : The demand for disposable respiratory protective devices needed to protect health care personnel may exceed supply during large outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases.1,2 Concerns are growing over global shortages of respiratory protective devices during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.3 A reusable alternative to N95 respirators for which health care personnel can be rapidly assessed for fit (fit testing) and trained for use is needed. Elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHMRs), which provide the same level of respiratory protection as N95 respirators, are one alternative4 (eFigure in Supplement 1). These reusable respirators are used in construction and manufacturing, but not widely used in health care4 because of uncertainty about disinfection methods and upfront costs.5 The goal of this demonstration study was to test the feasibility of rapidly training and fit testing health care workers to EHMRs.\n",

Climate change, international terrorism, pandemics, and cyberwarfare are only some of the ways in which injury, morbidity, and mortality can spread rapidly to millions of people. Ebola, as tragic as it has been, is but a small example of what could occur if, for instance, a nuclear blast went off in New York, sea level surges flooded Florida, or the electric grid went down in a health emergency. The current coronavirus epidemic in China has created a major international public health threat, led to the full or partial quarantine of nearly 45 million people, and interrupted commerce in many cities.1\n",

Appropriately, much attention has addressed the acute challenges in caring for this surge of critically ill patients. What has received less attention, however, is what happens as patients—most of whom will recover, even in the highest-risk groups—begin to do so. Many patients with COVID-19 will need postacute care to recuperate from their infection. However, postacute care facilities currently lack the capacity and capability to safely treat patients with COVID-19 as they transition from the hospital to other care settings or to their homes. In this Viewpoint, we present the scope of the problem and outline a series of steps that may be helpful as postacute care organizations prepare for the coming increase in patients with COVID-19.\n",

            "n 2016, an explosion at a factory of the Chinese industrial giant Qilu Pharmaceutical resulted in suspension of operations.1 The factory was the sole global manufacturer of several active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). APIs are the chemical building blocks used in making a diverse number of antimicrobial agents. The explosion exacerbated an existing shortage of this vital antibiotic agent that is widely used in hospitals around the world. Since December 2014, manufacturing issues at 2 of 8 suppliers of piperacillin-tazobactam and regulatory issues at another manufacturer, combined with increasing demand for the drug, had produced unprecedented shortages in the US. The worldwide situation led many domestic and overseas hospitals to ration piperacillin-tazobactam and to substitute cephalosporin and carbapenem agents.2 Some hospitals dealt with the shortage by limiting use of piperacillin-tazobactam to patients with severe sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia at the expense of the greater use of other normally restricted and rationed antibacterial drugs.\n",

            "edical masks are a tool that can be used to prevent the spread of respiratory infection.; Medical masks are a type of personal protective equipment used to prevent the spread of respiratory infections. These masks cover the mouth and nose of the wearer and, if worn properly, may be effective at helping prevent transmission of respiratory viruses and bacteria.; There are 2 main types of masks used to prevent respiratory infection: surgical masks, sometimes referred to as face masks, and respirators. These masks differ by the type and size of infectious particles they are able to filter. Face masks are used more commonly for respiratory viruses that spread via droplets, which travel short distances and are transmitted by cough or sneeze. Face masks often fit loosely, and prevent the wearer from spreading large sprays and droplets, as well as preventing hand-to-face contact. N95 respirators block 95% of airborne particles. They are tight fitting and prevent inhalation of smaller infectious particles that can spread through the air over long distances after an infected person coughs or sneezes. Diseases that require use of an N95 respirator include tuberculosis, chickenpox, and measles. N95 respirators cannot be used by individuals with facial hair or by children because it is difficult to achieve a proper fit. In those cases, a special respirator called a powered air-purifying respirator may be used instead.\n",

Each year for 4 years, during the 12-week period of peak viral respiratory illness, pairs of outpatient sites (clusters) within each center were matched and randomly assigned to the N95 respirator or medical mask groups.</p><h3>Interventions</h3><p>Overall, 1993 participants in 189 clusters were randomly assigned to wear N95 respirators (2512 HCP-seasons of observation) and 2058 in 191 clusters were randomly assigned to wear medical masks (2668 HCP-seasons) when near patients with respiratory illness.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Secondary outcomes included incidence of acute respiratory illness, laboratory-detected respiratory infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory illness, and influenzalike illness. Adherence to interventions was assessed.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Among 2862 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 43 [11.5] years; 2369 [82.8%]) women), 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCP-seasons. There were 207 laboratory-confirmed influenza infection events (8.2% of HCP-seasons) in the N95 respirator group and 193 (7.2% of HCP-seasons) in the medical mask group (difference, 1.0%, [95% CI, −0.5% to 2.5%];<i>P</i> = .18) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.18 [95% CI, 0.95-1.45]). There were 1556 acute respiratory illness events in the respirator group vs 1711 in the mask group (difference, −21.9 per 1000 HCP-seasons [95% CI, −48.2 to 4.4];<i>P</i> = .10); 679 laboratory-detected respiratory infections in the respirator group vs 745 in the mask group (difference, −8.9 per 1000 HCP-seasons, [95% CI, −33.3 to 15.4];<i>P</i> = .47); 371 laboratory-confirmed respiratory illness events in the respirator group vs 417 in the mask group (difference, −8.6 per 1000 HCP-seasons [95% CI, −28.2 to 10.9];<i>P</i> = .39); and 128 influenzalike illness events in the respirator group vs 166 in the mask group (difference, −11.3 per 1000 HCP-seasons [95% CI, −23.8 to 1.3];<i>P</i> = .08). In the respirator group, 89.4% of participants reported “always” or “sometimes” wearing their assigned devices vs 90.2% in the mask group.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p><h3>Trial Registration</h3><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT01249625</p>\n",

Historically, the process of vaccine development through to licensure requires decades; however, clinicians and public health officials are often faced with outbreaks of viral diseases, sometimes of a pandemic nature that would require vaccines for adequate control. New viral diseases emerge from zoonotic and vectorborne sources, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Chikungunya, and while these diseases are often detected in resource-rich countries, they usually begin in low- and mid-income countries.1 Therefore, part of the timeline for a vaccine involves surveillance and detection of new pathogens in remote areas and transfer of specimens to laboratories capable of vaccine development.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>The population of infants, children, and adolescents cared for at pediatric long-term care facilities is increasing in complexity and size and thus consumes substantial health care resources. Infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, but few recent data describe their incidence and effects.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p>To describe the types of infections diagnosed in residents of pediatric long-term care facilities, calculate infection rates, and identify risk factors for respiratory tract infections (RTIs).</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This prospective cohort study, which was part of a larger trial called Keep It Clean for Kids, was conducted from September 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, at 3 pediatric long-term care facilities in New York. Residents of the facilities who were 21 years or younger and either residents or admitted during the study period (n = 717) were enrolled in the study. Medical records were reviewed to identify infections diagnosed by site clinicians.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Incidence of infections, such as RTIs; skin and soft-tissue infections; chronic comorbid conditions, including neurologic and respiratory disorders; and device use, including gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies, was determined. Risk factors for RTIs were assessed by generalized linear mixed method regression modeling.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The 717 residents had a median (interquartile range) age at enrollment of 2.6 (0.4-9.1) years; 358 (49.9%) were male. Four hundred twenty-eight residents (59.7%) had feeding tubes and 215 (30.0%) had tracheostomies. Most chronic comorbid conditions were musculoskeletal or ambulation (532 residents [74.2%]), neurologic (505 [70.4%]), respiratory (361 [50.3%]), and gastrointestinal (230 [32.1%]) disorders, and 460 residents (64.2%) had 4 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Site clinicians diagnosed 2052 infections during the 3-year study period. Respiratory tract infections were most common and were diagnosed in 1291 residents (62.9%). The overall infection rate was 5.3 infections per 1000 resident-days, and RTI rates were 3.3 infections per 1000 resident-days. Overall infection rates and rates of RTI, skin and soft-tissue infection, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection varied among the 3 sites. In the multivariable model, younger age (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06), increased number of chronic comorbid conditions (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.19), and the use of feeding tubes (IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64) and tracheostomies (IRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.69) were associated with RTIs.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this study, RTIs were the most common infections diagnosed, but modifiable risk factors for RTIs were not identified. Future work should focus on optimizing infection prevention and control strategies to reduce infections, particularly RTIs, in the pediatric long-term care population.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Epidemiological studies support a link between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and a higher risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections. However, whether winter supplementation of vitamin D reduces the risk among children is unknown.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To determine whether high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in young children.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>A randomized clinical trial was conducted during the winter months between September 13, 2011, and June 30, 2015, among children aged 1 through 5 years enrolled in TARGet Kids!, a multisite primary care practice–based research network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p><h3>Interventions</h3><p>Three hundred forty-nine participants were randomized to receive 2000 IU/d of vitamin D oral supplementation (high-dose group) vs 354 participants who were randomized to receive 400 IU/d (standard-dose group) for a minimum of 4 months between September and May.</p><h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3><p>The primary outcome was the number of laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory tract infections based on parent-collected nasal swabs over the winter months. Secondary outcomes included the number of influenza infections, noninfluenza infections, parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses, time to first upper respiratory tract infection, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at study termination.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Among 703 participants who were randomized (mean age, 2.7 years, 57.7% boys), 699 (99.4%) completed the trial. The mean number of laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infections per child was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19) for the high-dose group and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.16) for the standard-dose group, for a between-group difference of 0.02 (95% CI, −0.17 to 0.21) per child. There was no statistically significant difference in number of laboratory-confirmed infections between groups (incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16). There was also no significant difference in the median time to the first laboratory-confirmed infection: 3.95 months (95% CI, 3.02-5.95 months) for the high-dose group vs 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.66-4.14 months) for the standard-dose group, or number of parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses between groups (625 for high-dose vs 600 for standard-dose groups, incidence RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16). At study termination, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 48.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 46.9-50.5 ng/mL) in the high-dose group and 36.8 ng/mL (95% CI, 35.4-38.2 ng/mL) in the standard-dose group.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily administration of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper respiratory tract infections. These findings do not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections.</p><h3>Trial Registration</h3><p>clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01419262</p>\n",

What’s more, those who were infected on the job generally had mild symptoms, which may have allowed some infections to go undetected, transmitting the virus to susceptible patients.; Endemic to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, MERS-CoV infection is likely transmitted to humans from dromedary camels. Since MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012, 624 deaths have occurred among 1728 laboratory-confirmed cases globally.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Medical errors and adverse events (AEs) are common among hospitalized children. While clinician reports are the foundation of operational hospital safety surveillance and a key component of multifaceted research surveillance, patient and family reports are not routinely gathered. We hypothesized that a novel family-reporting mechanism would improve incident detection.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To compare error and AE rates (1) gathered systematically with vs without family reporting, (2) reported by families vs clinicians, and (3) reported by families vs hospital incident reports.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study including the parents/caregivers of 989 hospitalized patients 17 years and younger (total 3902 patient-days) and their clinicians from December 2014 to July 2015 in 4 US pediatric centers. Clinician abstractors identified potential errors and AEs by reviewing medical records, hospital incident reports, and clinician reports as well as weekly and discharge Family Safety Interviews (FSIs). Two physicians reviewed and independently categorized all incidents, rating severity and preventability (agreement, 68%-90%; κ, 0.50-0.68). Discordant categorizations were reconciled. Rates were generated using Poisson regression estimated via generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures on the same patient.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Error and AE rates.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Overall, 746 parents/caregivers consented for the study. Of these, 717 completed FSIs. Their median (interquartile range) age was 32.5 (26-40) years; 380 (53.0%) were nonwhite, 566 (78.9%) were female, 603 (84.1%) were English speaking, and 380 (53.0%) had attended college. Of 717 parents/caregivers completing FSIs, 185 (25.8%) reported a total of 255 incidents, which were classified as 132 safety concerns (51.8%), 102 nonsafety-related quality concerns (40.0%), and 21 other concerns (8.2%). These included 22 preventable AEs (8.6%), 17 nonharmful medical errors (6.7%), and 11 nonpreventable AEs (4.3%) on the study unit. In total, 179 errors and 113 AEs were identified from all sources. Family reports included 8 otherwise unidentified AEs, including 7 preventable AEs. Error rates with family reporting (45.9 per 1000 patient-days) were 1.2-fold (95% CI, 1.1-1.2) higher than rates without family reporting (39.7 per 1000 patient-days). Adverse event rates with family reporting (28.7 per 1000 patient-days) were 1.1-fold (95% CI, 1.0-1.2;<i>P </i>=<i> </i>.006) higher than rates without (26.1 per 1000 patient-days). Families and clinicians reported similar rates of errors (10.0 vs 12.8 per 1000 patient-days; relative rate, 0.8; 95% CI, .5-1.2) and AEs (8.5 vs 6.2 per 1000 patient-days; relative rate, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2). Family-reported error rates were 5.0-fold (95% CI, 1.9-13.0) higher and AE rates 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2-6.7) higher than hospital incident report rates.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Families provide unique information about hospital safety and should be included in hospital safety surveillance in order to facilitate better design and assessment of interventions to improve safety.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Importance</h3><p>Management of febrile children is an intrinsic aspect of pediatric practice. Febrile children account for 15% of emergency department visits and outcomes range from the presence of serious bacterial infection to benign self-limited illness.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Studies from 1979 to 2015 examining febrile infants and children were included in this review. Management of febrile infants younger than 90 days has evolved considerably in the last 30 years. Increased rates of<i>Escherichia coli</i>urinary tract infections, increasing resistance to ampicillin, and advances in viral diagnostics have had an effect on the approach to caring for these patients. Widespread vaccination with conjugate vaccines against<i>Haemophilus influenzae </i>and<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>has virtually eliminated the concern for bacterial infections in children aged 3 to 36 months. Urinary tract infections still remain a concern in febrile infants of all ages.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Advances over the last 30 years allow for more precise risk stratification for infants at high risk of serious bacterial infection. With appropriate testing at the initial visit, much of the diagnostic testing and empirical treatment can be avoided for infants younger than 90 days. In the vaccinated child aged 3 to 36 months, the only bacterial infection of concern is urinary tract infection.</p>\n",

The importance of intensive care facilities as a global good was emphasized by recent epidemics in which survival was highly dependent on adequate critical care. Examples include the SARS coronavirus (2002-2003), avian influenza H5N1 (2004 and onward), pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (2009), the MERS coronavirus (2012 and onward), and Ebola virus disease (2014-2015).\n",

            "Full body : The individual, societal, and economic benefits of disease prevention resulting from childhood and adult immunization programs in the United States are without question. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describing the benefits of vaccination of the 2009 birth cohort through 18 years of age estimated that 20 million cases of vaccine-preventable disease will not occur, 42 000 early deaths related to these diseases will be avoided, and $76 billion in direct and indirect costs will be averted.1 This economic benefit stands in stark contrast to the comparatively small cost for vaccine purchases. The estimated vaccine purchasing cost for a similar birth cohort based on 2015 pricing is $7.8 billion, based on CDC costs, and $11.6 billion at private sector pricing (eTable in the Supplement).2\n",

            "n May 2013, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan warned that a novel coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), posed “a threat to the entire world.”1 Her warning was prescient. As of June 12, 2015, WHO had been notified of 1289 individuals with laboratory-confirmed infections in 25 countries, of whom at least 455 individuals (37%) had died.2 More than 85% of cases have been diagnosed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.; Unlike the distantly related, more contagious, but less fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV had not been publicly linked to a “super-spreading” event (1 patient linked to ≥10 infections) until May 2015 in the Republic of Korea. When the index case, a man aged 68 years from the Republic of Korea, returned to Incheon International Airport (located 30 miles west of Seoul) on May 4, he was asymptomatic. He reportedly had traveled to Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, but initially declared travel only to outbreak-free Bahrain. He became symptomatic on May 11 and sought care in 2 outpatient clinics and 2 hospitals. He was eventually admitted to Pyeongtaek St Mary’s hospital, Gyeonggi province, but MERS-CoV was unconfirmed until May 20, reportedly initiating chains of transmission that increased to involve 126 cases with 11 deaths as of June 10. The index patient was still hospitalized as of June 12.\n",

            "Full body : Can we protect ourselves? Can we protect our community? With the emergence of the Ebola virus outbreak, these questions have captured the attention of the American audience; however, these issues are hardly new to the US health care system. Caring for individuals with presumptive or confirmed pathogens of high consequence, such as Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pandemic influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, to name a few, provokes not only technical but also ethical dilemmas to our current health care infrastructure. While we mostly understand the science of infectious disease transmission and recognize that intensive medical care generally improves outcomes, what remains less certain is how to provide supportive care safely and compassionately. This is especially apparent in the care of a vulnerable infected child. Parents are often encouraged to aid in hands-on care of their hospitalized child, making parental presence the cornerstone of family-centered care. However, in suspected or confirmed cases where pathogens are of high consequence, we posit that parental presence may pose significant risk to the patient, parents, health care professionals, and public. We believe infections with high-consequence pathogens fundamentally alter our risk-benefit calculus and that, in these scenarios, temporary physical separation of the infected child from parents is the most effective option for safe care delivery. We challenge the pediatric medical community to view patient isolation and parental separation not as a threat to family-centered care but rather as an opportunity to reflect on our care provision, foster innovation and creativity, and cultivate a new sensitivity in family centeredness.\n",

Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are known to precede olfactory dysfunction in some patients. To our knowledge, there has been no study assessing the possible relationship between influenza vaccination status and olfactory dysfunction.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To compare vaccination status of a group of patients with subjective olfactory dysfunction with that of a group of controls.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>Retrospective medical record review and telephone survey in a matched case-control study. Forty-two patients were identified via diagnosis codes who presented to a tertiary care academic rhinologic center with subjective smell dysfunction over the course of 1 year. Only post-URI and idiopathic etiologies were included. Forty-two age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched control patients were also selected.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Demographic data, influenza vaccination status, and smoking status were reviewed. χ<sup>2</sup>Testing was used.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>We were able to obtain vaccination data for 36 of 42 patients in the olfactory dysfunction group and 38 of 42 in the control group. Seven of the 36 (19%) in the olfactory dysfunction group had received the vaccine in the year prior to presentation compared with 16 of 38 (42%) in the control group (<i>P</i> = .04).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Influenza vaccination seems to be associated with a decreased rate of subjective olfactory dysfunction. This is a preliminary finding, and further studies would be needed to elucidate the exact role of influenza and influenza vaccination in patients with olfactory loss.</p>\n",

The epidemic could have major ramifications for global public health in ways that no other modern infectious disease has, perhaps including AIDS, and can be viewed as a “Black Swan” event. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the Lebanese-American author and scholar, introduced the metaphor of the black swan, a bird that was once thought not to exist, to explain financial events. Subsequently, Taleb extended the Black Swan concept, in his 2007 book of the same name, beyond finance to explain high-profile, difficult-to-predict, and rare events in history and the present1(ppxxi-xxii):\n",

To explore this possibility, scientists in Saudi Arabia and the United States carried out a geographic and temporal survey on 203 dromedaries from different regions of Saudi Arabia and found that 150 (74%) of the animals had antibodies to the MERS coronavirus. Archived serum samples obtained from dromedaries from 1992 to 2010 indicated that the MERS virus or a closely related virus has been circulating in the animals since at least 1992.\n",

Now a new study bolsters the case that bats may have directly transmitted the SARS virus to humans.; The emergence of SARS in China and its rapid spread around the world drew attention to the public health importance of zoonotic diseases. Ultimately, the SARS pandemic grew to an estimated 8000 cases and 750 deaths. It also launched investigations into the source of the infection that continue to this day.\n",

            "nfectious disease is among the most complex and dynamic of all medical specialties, with near-constant change in organisms, drugs, and approaches to patient care. Ironically, while advances in public health have been driven historically by management of infections, the body of evidence that guides contemporary practice in infectious diseases remains relatively limited. Many infection-related threats, such as avian influenza, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, and the growth of multidrug-resistant organisms with a lean pipeline for novel anti-infectives, are current concerns. Past outbreaks of SARS, pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and iatrogenic fungal meningitis are reminders that others await and, on arrival, will leave the public health and infectious diseases communities scrambling for solutions only after serious illness results.\n",

            "Full body : A new coronavirus that causes potentially fatal respiratory illness apparently can spread from person to person.; The first cases of human infection with the new coronavirus occurred last April near Amman, Jordan. Genetic testing has shown that it's different from any other known coronavirus and that it is most closely related to coronaviruses found in bats. Health officials in the United States have reported that 14 cases (with 8 deaths) have been confirmed worldwide. Three of the cases occurred in 1 family in the United Kingdom, prompting the UK Health Protection Agency to conclude that person-to-person transmission took place within the family.\n",

            "Full body : Another round of emerging infections is causing great concern among health authorities and the public. This February, a newly recognized novel influenza subtype (H7N9) appeared in China. By June, at least 38 deaths were attributed to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a worrisome relative of the virus that spawned the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak.1 Although that outbreak occurred only 10 years ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome seems to have been erased from the collective memory of many health professionals. The same can be said of novel influenza. Today, the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic seems like ancient history. When it comes to emerging infections, short attention spans and poor memories often prevail, with serious consequences.\n",

These DM-specific Abs were mutually exclusive and were detected in none of 34 patients with polymyositis, 326 with systemic sclerosis, and 97 with systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti–Mi-2 was associated with classical DM without interstitial lung disease or malignancy, whereas anti–155/140 was associated with malignancy. Patients with anti–CADM-140 frequently had clinically amyopathic DM and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Cumulative survival rates were more favorable in patients with anti–Mi-2 compared with those with anti–155/140 or anti–CADM-140 (<i>P</i> &lt; .01 for both comparisons). Nearly all deaths occurred within 1 year after diagnosis in patients with anti–CADM-140.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Dermatomyositis-specific Abs define clinically distinct subsets and are useful for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with DM.</p>\n",

Compared with the previous winter, the incidence of ECMO use was far greater in conjunction with H1N1 infections.; Only 20 patients (32%) were treated with inhaled nitric oxide before initiation of ECMO, although this therapy is considered an effective rescue treatment of refractory hypoxemia in acute lung injury.2 Moreover, it is not reported whether inhaled nitric oxide was continued on ECMO and what concentrations were used. In addition to providing selective pulmonary vasodilation, inhaled nitric oxide may be an effective topical anti-infective agent,3 with activity against the replication of influenza viruses in vitro.4 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, an antiviral effect on the SARS coronavirus was reported.5 It remains to be determined whether inhaled nitric oxide might be a therapy for H1N1-induced acute respiratory failure that could reduce the need for and the duration of ECMO treatment.\n",

A concurrent CLI was diagnosed for 34% of the PCR<sup>+</sup>samples and for 18% of the samples found to be negative by PCR analysis (PCR<sup>−</sup>). Cytokine concentrations and ratios were highly variable and skewed to the lower values. The significance of the cytokine concentrations and ratios as discriminators of groups defined by the presence or absence of virus and of subgroups defined by the presence or absence of a CLI was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. All measures were significant discriminators of the PCR<sup>+</sup>vs PCR<sup>−</sup>groups, and most were significant discriminators of the paired CLI subgroups. The concentration of IL-6 and the IL-5/IL-6 ratio were the best discriminators across all groups and subgroups. However, the sensitivities and specificities of those discriminators at the best cutoff values were on the order of 0.7 for the most extreme pairwise comparison (PCR<sup>+</sup>CLI<sup>+</sup>vs PCR<sup>−</sup>CLI<sup>−</sup>) and lower for the other comparison groups.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The low sensitivities and specificities for cytokine-based assignment of specimens to the paired groups and subgroups limit their usefulness for diagnosis of infection or illness.</p>\n",

            "Full body : Despite all of the problems that have arisen while trying to contain and minimize the effects of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, the ease with which it has spread around the globe, the social disruption it has spawned, the difficulties encountered in producing and distributing an effective vaccine in a timely manner and in overcoming widespread doubts about its safety, and the emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy, things could have been a whole lot worse. It now appears (as of mid November 2009) that mortality from this particular strain of influenza is less than that of the “regular” seasonal flu. However, considering the 40% to 70% mortality rate among persons unfortunate enough to have been stricken with avian influenza A(H5N1), which first appeared in Southeast Asia in 1997 and which has since become endemic throughout the world's bird population, leads to an appreciation of just how bad a pandemic of a different, more virulent strain of flu could have been.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Context</h3>Data about the effectiveness of the surgical mask compared with the N95 respirator for protecting health care workers against influenza are sparse. Given the likelihood that N95 respirators will be in short supply during a pandemic and not available in many countries, knowing the effectiveness of the surgical mask is of public health importance.<h3>Objective</h3>To compare the surgical mask with the N95 respirator in protecting health care workers against influenza.<h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3>Noninferiority randomized controlled trial of 446 nurses in emergency departments, medical units, and pediatric units in 8 tertiary care Ontario hospitals.<h3>Intervention</h3>Assignment to either a fit-tested N95 respirator or a surgical mask when providing care to patients with febrile respiratory illness during the 2008-2009 influenza season.<h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3>The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza measured by polymerase chain reaction or a 4-fold rise in hemagglutinin titers. Effectiveness of the surgical mask was assessed as noninferiority of the surgical mask compared with the N95 respirator. The criterion for noninferiority was met if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the reduction in incidence (N95 respirator minus surgical group) was greater than −9%.<h3>Results</h3>Between September 23, 2008, and December 8, 2008, 478 nurses were assessed for eligibility and 446 nurses were enrolled and randomly assigned the intervention; 225 were allocated to receive surgical masks and 221 to N95 respirators. Influenza infection occurred in 50 nurses (23.6%) in the surgical mask group and in 48 (22.9%) in the N95 respirator group (absolute risk difference, −0.73%; 95% CI, −8.8% to 7.3%; P = .86), the lower confidence limit being inside the noninferiority limit of −9%.<h3>Conclusion</h3>Among nurses in Ontario tertiary care hospitals, use of a surgical mask compared with an N95 respirator resulted in noninferior rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza.<h3>Trial Registration</h3>clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00756574Published online October 1, 2009 (doi:10.1001/jama.2009.1466).\n",

            "Full body : Dictionaries define that for something to “emerge” it has to rise from an obscure or inferior position. One could say that humans, by vanquishing the threats of infectious diseases, have emerged as one of the dominant species on the planet. But an ominous foreshadowing of the history of infectious diseases is contained in another dictionary definition of “emerge,” in which emergence refers to coming into being through evolution.; While the human species has developed an armamentarium to ward off the known infectious threats to health, the microbial world has not been idle. One only has to peruse newspaper headlines to realize that reports of emerging infections are increasing at an alarming rate. Humans around the world are continually battling viruses, bacteria, prions, and parasites. Sorting through the plethora of new infectious threats to human health and biosecurity can be daunting, even for infectious disease specialists. The rapid-fire pace with which new discoveries of unknown pathogens are announced makes most textbooks irrelevant when it comes to this topic, and one is left to use Internet search engines when colleagues or patients inquire about some exotic new infection creating havoc on the other side of the globe. A recent review on this topic begins with a fitting 19th-century quote from Rudolf Virchow: “Not a single year passes without [which] . . . we can tell the world: here is a new disease!”1\n",

            "Full body : Geneticists say that “Everything is genetic, except maybe trauma.” Genomics and Clinical Medicine confirms this axiom and notes that the body's response to physical injury also has genetic underpinnings. Arguably, however, the saying should be updated to state that “Everything is genomic, except maybe trauma.” The difference is more than mere definition. “Genetics” focuses on single genes and their effects, whereas “genomics” refers to the action of all of the genes in an organism. Genomics also refers to a set of associated technologies (eg, high-throughput sequencing, expression profiling with microarrays). Genomics, in both senses, was largely born of the Human Genome Project—the effort to sequence the human genome.\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Background</h3><p>Each winter respiratory viruses account for a significant proportion of serious respiratory illness, including hospitalization, in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Infection with HMPV was identified in 3 prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons 19-40 years old, healthy adults ≥65 years old, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort for 4 consecutive winters (November 15 through April 15 for the years 1999 through 2003). The incidence and clinical impact were compared with those of influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus infection in the same groups.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and serologic testing, we identified HMPV infection in 2.2% to 10.5% of the 3 prospectively followed-up outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 38.8% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they occurred, were typical of an upper respiratory tract illness, although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized patients, HMPV was identified in 8.5% (range, 4.4%-13.2%), depending on the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to those for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>In adults of all ages, HMPV is a common infection, and, although often asymptomatic, it can result in serious infection that requires hospitalization. Like influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, HMPV is also a major contributor to the burden of wintertime respiratory illnesses in older adults.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Background</h3><p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) became a global epidemic in 2003. Comprehensive information on 1-year outcomes and health care utilization is lacking. Research conducted during the SARS outbreak may help inform research planning for future public health emergencies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes in survivors of SARS and their family caregivers.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>The study was prospective and observational. We evaluated 117 SARS survivors from Toronto, Ontario. Patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, a 6-minute-walk test, quality-of-life measures, and self-report of health care utilization. At 1 year, informal caregivers were identified for a survey on caregiver burden.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The enrolled survivors of SARS were young (median age, 42 years), and most were women (67%) and health care workers (65%). At 1 year after hospital discharge, pulmonary function measures were in the normal range, but 18% of patients had a significant reduction in distance walked in 6 minutes. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) domains were 0.3 to 1.0 SD below normal at 1 year. Of the patients, 17% had not returned to work by 1 year. Fifty-one patients required 668 visits to psychiatry or psychology practitioners. During the SARS epidemic, informal caregivers reported a decline of 1.6 SD below normal on the mental component score of the SF-36.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Most SARS survivors had good physical recovery from their illness, but some patients and their caregivers reported a significant reduction in mental health 1 year later. Strategies to ameliorate the psychological burden of an epidemic on the patient and family caregiver should be considered as part of future pandemic planning.</p>\n",

            "Full body : Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have shown that mice previously exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus are capable of halting the virus's replication upon reinfection (J Virol. 2004;78:3572-3577). The findings are encouraging to scientists who are trying to develop an effective vaccine against SARS.; Although the SARS virus does not make mice sick, it is able to infect and replicate in the cells lining mouse airways and lungs. The new study found that mice that are infected with SARS produce neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which then protected the mice from a subsequent infection.\n",

Effective July 1, 2003, SARS-CoV disease was added to the list of nationally notifiable conditions as designated by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and with concurrence from CDC.1 The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) is the official source of SARS-CoV disease case counts.; No SARS-CoV disease cases were reported in the United States from July 1, 2003 (27th week) through December 6, 2003 (49th week). However, as an aid to future data interpretation and comparison, SARS-CoV incidence data were included in NNDSS for the first half of the year (week ending January 4, 2003, [first week] through week ending June 28, 2003 [26th week]). Cumulative SARS-CoV disease incidence data for MMWR weeks 1-49 (week ending December 6, 2003) are presented in Table I.\n",

            "Full body : It is unfortunate that this interesting and unusual collection of disparate analyses and essays should be subtitled with a question, the easy answer to which is, no (8000 cases do not a pandemic make).; The multifaceted articles collected in this compact volume are derived from a conference organized by editors and coauthors Arthur Kleinman and James L. Watson, held in September 2003 at the Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University. This explains the complementary and cohesive nature of the essays and also, perhaps, some redundancy as the same events are viewed by coauthors representing different disciplines. The emphasis is less medical and epidemiologic than political and sociological, but it should hold the attention of any physician concerned with public health.\n",

We developed and validated prognostic rules for both high- and low-resource settings based on data available at the time of admission.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We analyzed data on all 1755 and 291 patients with SARS in Hong Kong (derivation cohort) and Toronto (validation cohort), respectively, using a multivariable logistic scoring method with internal and external validation. Scores were assigned on the basis of patient history in a basic model, and a full model additionally incorporated radiological and laboratory results. The main outcome measure was death.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Predictors for mortality in the basic model included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Additional predictors in the full model included haziness or infiltrates on chest radiography, less than 95% oxygen saturation on room air, high lactate dehydrogenase level, and high neutrophil and low platelet counts. The basic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.860 in the derivation cohort, which was maintained on external validation with an area under the ROC curve of 0.882. The full model improved discrimination with areas under the ROC curve of 0.877 and 0.892 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The model performs well and could be useful in assessing prognosis for patients who are infected with re-emergent SARS.</p>\n",

            "Full body : When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) surfaced in 2003, the molecular mechanism underlying the SARS coronavirus’ ability to cause often lethal severe acute lung failure was a mystery. Now, researchers from Austria, China, the United States, and Canada have discovered a clue to how the SARS virus damages the lungs.; Previous studies in cultured cells had identified a protein known for its role in regulating blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a potential receptor for the SARS coronavirus. In the new work, reported on July 10 in the online edition of Nature Medicine (http://www.nature.com/nm/index.html), researchers demonstrated in mice that ACE2 is a crucial receptor for the virus in vivo. They found that when the Spike protein of the SARS virus binds to ACE2, it reduces ACE2 expression and blood vessels in the lungs leak fluid and damage the tissue.\n",

            "Full body : Two research teams have independently identified the Chinese horseshoe bat as the natural viral reservoir from which the SARS coronavirus that infected humans likely emerged. SARS, first appearing in China in 2002, spread from Asia to Canada and other countries, infecting more than 8000 individuals and killing 774 worldwide.; The research teams looked at bats as a possible reservoir because these animals are well suited to transmit zoonotic diseases: they are genetically diverse, live longer than most small mammals, roost in clusters, and fly long distances. In addition, many people in Asia eat bats or use their feces for medicinal purposes. Each team collected anal swabs and serum samples from hundreds of bats from the wild and from Chinese markets; they found that SARS-like viruses were present in many fecal samples and that most blood samples contained antibodies against the viruses. One team, with members from China, Australia, and the United States, reported its findings in Science (Li et al. http://www.sciencemag.org), while the other team, from the University of Hong Kong, reported its findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (Lau et al. http://www.pnas.org).\n",

Industrialized countries place great emphasis on scientific solutions. The White House strategic plan and congressional appropriation both devote more than 90% of pandemic influenza spending to vaccines and antiviral medications.2 Yet, medical countermeasures, discussed in a previous JAMA Commentary, will not impede pandemic spread: experimental H5N1 vaccines may not be effective against a novel human subtype, neuraminidase inhibitors may become resistant, and medical countermeasures will be extremely scarce.3 This Commentary focuses on traditional public health interventions, drawing lessons from past influenza pandemics and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)4 (Table).\n",

            "Full body : The management of emerging and reemerging infections in today's health care practice is daunting, to say the least. We are all aware of the seemingly constant recognition of new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus1 and avian influenza,2 as well as the introduction of new faces on old pathogens, exemplified by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa4 and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).5 The spread of these and other infectious diseases is the result of 3 interrelated factors: the relationship(s) between microorganisms, their hosts, and the environment.6 Critical tools for management of health care–associated infections are comprehensive infection-control practices that are often insufficiently followed.7 In this issue of the ARCHIVES, Vernon and colleagues8 evaluate a novel intervention with the focus on interrupting the host as a reservoir for contamination of the environment and health care workers to halt the spread of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. These investigators, working in a large metropolitan Chicago hospital, ask, Does lowering the microbial density of health care–associated pathogens for all patients in intensive care units decrease the contamination of the environment and health care workers' hands and thus result in less microbial spread to other patients in the unit? They addressed the question by using vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) as the microbial target because of its propensity for skin and environmental contamination9,10 and used chlorhexidine gluconate as the skin disinfectant because it is effective and has little potential for toxic effects.\n",

            "Full body : In Reply: Dr Mahendradhata is correct in pointing out the importance of public health measures in the detection, treatment, and prevention of infectious disease. As I stated in the Editorial, the best defenses against emerging microbial pathogens are “public health measures coordinated with biomedical research.” Developing strategies to measure the effectiveness of health care delivery is certainly an important part of a robust public health effort.; The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak offers an excellent example of how a multifaceted effort by public health agencies and researchers around the world led to the successful containment of a fatal disease.1 Public health efforts, including case identification, case isolation, contact tracing, and infection control, along with state-of-the art biomedical and genomic technologies, allowed public health officials to rapidly identify the coronavirus as the etiologic agent, and to conduct effective surveillance of the virus as it emerged and evolved in different geographic regions. Without the coordination of public health measures and newly developed biotechnologies, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic might have rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic.\n",

            "Abstract : ContextOf children with sore throat, 15% to 36% have pharyngitis caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Performance of a GABHS test prior to antibiotic prescribing is recommended for children with sore throat. Penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and first-generation cephalosporins are the recommended antibiotics for treatment of sore throat due to GABHS.ObjectivesTo measure rates of antibiotic prescribing and GABHS testing and to evaluate the association between testing and antibiotic treatment for children with sore throat.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsAnalysis of visits by children aged 3 to 17 years with sore throat to office-based physicians, hospital outpatient departments, and emergency departments in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1995 to 2003 (N = 4158) and of a subset of visits with GABHS testing data (n = 2797).Main Outcome MeasuresNational rates of antibiotic prescribing, prescribing of antibiotics recommended and not recommended for GABHS, and GABHS testing.ResultsPhysicians prescribed antibiotics in 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49%-56%) of an estimated 7.3 million annual visits for sore throat and nonrecommended antibiotics to 27% (95% CI, 24%-31%) of children who received an antibiotic. Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 66% of visits in 1995 to 54% of visits in 2003 (P = .01 for trend). This decrease was attributable to a decrease in the prescribing of recommended antibiotics (49% to 38%; P = .002). Physicians performed a GABHS test in 53% (95% CI, 48%-57%) of visits and in 51% (95% CI, 45%-57%) of visits at which an antibiotic was prescribed. GABHS testing was not associated with a lower antibiotic prescribing rate overall (48% tested vs 51% not tested; P = .40), but testing was associated with a lower antibiotic prescribing rate for children with diagnosis codes for pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and streptococcal sore throat (57% tested vs 73% not tested; P&lt;.001).ConclusionsPhysicians prescribed antibiotics to 53% of children with sore throat, in excess of the maximum expected prevalence of GABHS. Although there was a decrease in the proportion of children receiving antibiotics between 1995 and 2003, this was due to decreased prescribing of agents recommended for GABHS. Although GABHS testing was associated with a lower rate of antibiotic prescribing for children with diagnosis codes of pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and streptococcal sore throat, GABHS testing was underused.\n",

Author Kay Richardson, a communications studies specialist at the University of Liverpool, England, analyzes the content, form, and imagery of online discourses on three different health concerns: cell phones and their potential to induce brain tumors, the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to spread rapidly, and the link between autism and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination.\n",

            "Full body : The coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rapidly achieved notoriety last year because of its capacity to cause an often fatal pneumonia. Now, findings from scientists in Hong Kong suggest that the SARS coronavirus may often cause subclinical infection without pneumonia in populations affected by outbreaks (Lancet. 2004;363:841-844).; The researchers examined the seroprevalence of the SARS virus in nearly 800 individuals without signs of respiratory tract infection, including healthy blood donors who gave blood during the Hong Kong SARS outbreak, health care workers, and children and adults hospitalized for other reasons. Three of the blood donors and one of the pediatric patients had evidence that they had been infected with the SARS coronavirus—an infection rate of about 0.5% compared with a rate of about 0.025% for SARS pneumonia among Hong Kong residents.\n",

            "Full body : In Reply: There are several major differences in study design as well as reported results between our study and that of Hemilä et al.1 Their study was designed to determine the effect of vitamin E and beta-carotene on lung cancer in middle-aged and elderly (50-69 years) male smokers; our study was limited to the elderly population (≥65 years), included both smokers and nonsmokers as well as both men and women, and had incidence of respiratory tract infection as the primary outcome. Our study used a higher daily dose of vitamin E than their study (200 IU/d of DL-α-tocopherol vs 50 mg/d of α-tocopherol). We used 200 IU/d because this dose had been demonstrated in an earlier study to induce the most robust improvement in immune function in the elderly population.2 In their study, the common cold incidence data were based on recall by the participants during thrice-annual visits; in contrast, we prospectively collected data once a week by means of an interview, focused physical examination, and chart review. Additionally, we assessed compliance with vitamin E supplementation by 3 different methods. Finally, while their study reported a reduction in the incidence of common colds only in elderly male smokers who resided in cities, we found a reduction in risk of acquiring common colds in the elderly regardless of sex or smoking status.\n",

            "Full body : One of the most demanding but engaging aspects of neurological practice is involvement in all aspects of medicine, from primary care of patients with migraine to consultation in the intensive care unit. There are few disorders that spare the nervous system, and neurologists participate in a vast range of problems. The neurological complications of newly emerging infections are no exception and have required active involvement. In the mid 1980s, neurological complications eventually linked to HIV infection ranged from primary dementia to small fiber sensory axonopathy. More recently, the impact of West Nile virus on the central and peripheral nervous systems has been devastating.\n",

Scientists have suggested that human consumption of exotic animals allowed the SARS coronavirus to leap the species barrier from animals to humans in China.; According to a statement released by the World Health Organization, the team issued a series of recommendations and actions necessary to identify the animal reservoir and contain any future outbreaks (http://www.who.int/en/). These measures include strengthening regulations in the farming, trading, and consumption of wildlife, and increased serological monitoring of the SARS coronavirus in both animals and humans.\n",

The study was published on February 22 in an online edition of Nature Medicine (http://www.nature.com/nm/).; The researchers gave six macaques doses of pegylated interferon α (IFN-α) shortly before infecting them with the SARS coronavirus. Two days later, the throats of the untreated control animals were teeming with virus, while the amount of virus shed from the treated monkeys was drastically reduced—an effect that may curb transmission. Pegylated IFN-α also reduced the severity of lung damage caused by the virus. The drug had similar but less-pronounced effects in four monkeys treated 1 and 3 days after exposure.\n",

The first recorded outbreak of paralytic disease in the United States occurred near Rutland, Vt, in 1894.1 Within a decade, thousands of infants and young children were permanently crippled during summertime epidemics that swept through cities on the East Coast and, later, throughout the country.2 The likely explanation for the dramatic emergence of epidemic polio during this era lies in the paradox of improved standards of hygiene, particularly the invention of the flush toilet, which reduced exposure to polioviruses in feces and delayed infection until the protective effect of passively acquired maternal antibodies had waned.3\n",

Nine patients (60%) were infected through household contact, 4 (27%) nosocomially, 1 (7%) through contact with a neighbor, and 1 (7%) after returning from Hong Kong. All 15 patients had fever, 3 (20%) had chills, and 11 (73%) had cough. Only 1 patient (7%) had sputum production; 1 (7%) had rhinorrhea. At presentation, 5 patients (33%) had leukopenia, 6 (40%) had lymphopenia, and 5 (33%) had monocytopenia. All children recovered without sequelae. Children with SARS had significantly lower incidences of rhinorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.09), sputum production (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63), and sore throat (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85) than children with influenza. Both groups had similar incidences of leukopenia or lymphopenia, but SARS patients had a significantly higher incidence of monocytopenia (33% vs 0%,<i>P</i> = .04).</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Childhood SARS is usually not fatal. The absence of rhinorrhea and presence of monocytopenia in SARS may distinguish it from influenza.</p>\n",

            "Abstract : <h3>Background</h3><p><i>Echinacea purpurea</i>stimulates the immune response and is promoted to reduce symptom severity and the duration of upper respiratory tract infections. We sought to determine the efficacy of a standardized preparation of<i>E purpurea</i>in reducing symptom severity and duration of the common cold.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. Patients received either 100 mg of<i>E purpurea</i>(freeze-dried pressed juice from the aerial portion of the plant) or a lactose placebo 3 times daily until cold symptoms were relieved or until the end of 14 days, whichever came first. Symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, sore or scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle aches, and cough) were scored subjectively by the patient and recorded daily in a diary. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the survival function of time to resolution in each group. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare time to resolution between the 2 groups.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled within 24 hours of cold symptom onset. Group demographic distribution was comparable for sex, age, time from symptom onset to enrollment in the study, average number of colds per year, and smoking history. No statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups for either total symptom scores (<i>P</i>range, .29-.90) or mean individual symptom scores (<i>P</i>range, .09-.93). The time to resolution of symptoms was not statistically different (<i>P</i>= .73).</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Some studies have concluded that<i>Echinacea</i>effectively reduces the symptoms and duration of the common cold. We were unable to replicate such findings. Further studies using different preparations and dosages of<i>E purpurea</i>are necessary to validate previous claims.</p>\n",

The surveillance case definition changed throughout the epidemic as understanding of the clinical, laboratory, and transmission characteristics of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) increased.1-5 On June 26, CSTE adopted a position statement to add SARS-CoV disease to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). The position statement included criteria for defining a SARS case for national reporting. On November 3, CSTE issued a new interim position statement* with a revised SARS case definition. This report summarizes the new U.S. surveillance case definition for SARS and updates reported cases of SARS worldwide and in the United States.\n",

            "Full body : ; On February 21, 2003, an ill physician traveling from China's Guangdong Province spent 1 night on the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel. During the next 24 hours, this individual would infect more than a dozen other hotel guests and visitors.1 Within days, these guests would transmit their infections to health care workers and family members in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada, providing a vivid illustration of the rapidity and ease with which infectious diseases can spread and marking the start of the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). One of the first persons to recognize the potential gravity of the situation was Carlo Urbani, an infectious disease physician working for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Hanoi. Urbani observed that a patient who had recently arrived from Hong Kong had a highly transmissible form of atypical pneumonia, and he promptly alerted WHO officials. His swift actions to investigate the cause of the illness and implement infection control measures proved effective in helping to limit the spread of the illness in Vietnam, the first affected country to stop its outbreak. Tragically, his heroic actions exposed him to the disease that claimed his life.\n",

SARS is highly contagious and is spread from person to person.; SARS is a viral illness, as are the common cold and influenza (flu). The type of virus that causes SARS is a coronavirus. Recent scientific studies have shown that some Asian animals carry viruses similar to the virus that causes SARS. These animals may have been the origin of the SARS virus that affects humans.

This report updates reported SARS cases worldwide and in the United States and summarizes changes in travel recommendations for provinces in China with the exclusion of Beijing, where a travel advisory remains.; During November 1, 2002–June 18, 2003, a total of 8,465 probable SARS cases were reported to WHO from 29 countries, including 75 from the United States; 801 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 9.5%) have been reported, with no SARS-related deaths reported from the United States.1 In the United States, a total of 409 SARS cases have been reported from 42 states and Puerto Rico, with 334 (82%) cases classified as suspect SARS and 75 (18%) classified as probable SARS (i.e., more severe illnesses characterized by the presence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome).2 Serologic testing for antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has been completed for 136 suspect and 45 probable cases. None of the suspect cases and eight (18%) of the probable cases have demonstrated antibodies to SARS-CoV, all of which have been described previously.3,4 Of the eight laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the United States, seven had traveled to areas with documented or suspected community transmission of SARS within the 10 days before illness onset. Of these, four reported travel to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; two to Toronto, Canada; and one to both Singapore and Taiwan. The remaining laboratory-confirmed SARS patient is the spouse of a laboratory-confirmed SARS patient that had traveled to Hong Kong.\n",

They donned N95 respirator masks and met a group of Chinese physicians—who promptly chuckled at the Americans' caution. No masks were needed, said the Chinese hosts, who themselves wore no exposure gear.; \"That set the tone,\" said Matthew Harting, one of the 14 fourth-year medical students from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center, who made the trip . The Chinese physicians were cautiously concerned but much less anxious than the students, who had devoured every tidbit of SARS news before leaving Houston. \"The physicians understood this was not a disease where you get it [through the air] and it leads to certain death.\"\n",

This report updates SARS cases reported worldwide and in the United States, and describes the eighth probable U.S. SARS case with laboratory evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection.; During November 1, 2002–June 11, 2003, a total of 8,435 probable SARS cases were reported to WHO from 29 countries, including 70 from the United States; 789 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 9.4%) have been reported, with no SARS-related deaths reported from the United States.1 In the United States, a total of 393 SARS cases have been reported from 42 states and Puerto Rico, with 323 (82%) cases classified as suspect SARS and 70 (18%) classified as probable SARS (i.e., more severe illnesses characterized by the presence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome).2 Of the 70 probable patients, 68 (97%) had traveled to areas with documented or suspected community transmission of SARS within the 10 days before illness onset; the remaining two (3%) patients were a health-care worker who provided care to a SARS patient and a household contact of a SARS patient (3). Of the 68 probable SARS cases attributed to travel, 35 (51%) patients reported travel to mainland China; 17 (25%) to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; five (7%) to Singapore; one (1%) to Hanoi, Vietnam; 14 (21%) to Toronto, Canada; and five (7%) to Taiwan; of these, seven (10%) reported travel to more than one of these areas.\n",

As of July 9, a total of 671 probable cases of SARS had been reported in Taiwan. On February 21, the first identified SARS patient in Taiwan returned from travel to Guangdong Province, mainland China, by way of Hong Kong. Initial efforts to control SARS appeared to be effective; these efforts included isolation of suspect and probable SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health-care workers (HCWs) and visitors, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients.1 However, beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent SARS-associated coronavirus transmission to other health-care facilities and community settings.2 In response to the growing epidemic, additional measures were taken to limit nosocomial and community transmission of SARS, including more widespread use of quarantine. By the end of the epidemic, 131,132 persons had been placed in quarantine, including 50,319 close contacts of SARS patients and 80,813 travelers from WHO-designated SARS-affected areas. This report describes the quarantine measures used in Taiwan and discusses the need for further evaluation of quarantine and other control measures used to prevent SARS.\n",

            "Full body : MMWR. 2003;52:547-550; 2 figures omitted; Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in Toronto in a woman who returned from Hong Kong on February 23, 2003.1 Transmission to other persons resulted subsequently in an outbreak among 257 persons in several Greater Toronto Area (GTA) hospitals. After implementation of provincewide public health measures that included strict infection-control practices, the number of recognized cases of SARS declined substantially, and no cases were detected after April 20. On April 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) lifted a travel advisory issued on April 22 that had recommended limiting travel to Toronto. This report describes a second wave of SARS cases among patients, visitors, and health-care workers (HCWs) that occurred at a Toronto hospital approximately 4 weeks after SARS transmission was thought to have been interrupted. The findings indicate that exposure to hospitalized patients with unrecognized SARS after a provincewide relaxation of strict SARS control measures probably contributed to transmission among HCWs. The investigation underscores the need for monitoring fever and respiratory symptoms in hospitalized patients and visitors, particularly after a decline in the number of reported SARS cases.\n",

For intensivists around the world, this scenerio is not an uncommon presentation for patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The only difference is that this patient with ARDS has the additional history that she \"recently returned from a trip to Hong Kong China\" and therefore has severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n",

Subsequent cases at eight hospitals have been associated with exposures at hospital A. Previously, all reported cases had been associated with persons recently returning to Taiwan from SARS-affected regions. This report summarizes epidemiologic findings of the outbreak in Taiwan and describes the impact of health-care–associated transmission of SARS.; As of May 22, a total of 483 probable cases had been reported. All probable SARS patients were hospitalized; 84 (17%) had been discharged, and 60 (12%) had died. The median age of probable SARS patients was 43 years (range: 9 months–91 years); 341 (71%) cases were from Taipei City and Taipei County, the largest metropolitan region of the island. The first patient reported had onset of illness on February 25; the majority of cases occurred after April 21 and were associated with transmission in health-care settings.\n",

Of these, 39 (16%) had illnesses characterized by the presence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome consistent with the interim U.S. surveillance case definition for probable SARS.2 The remaining 206 (84%) had fever and respiratory symptoms. Of the 39 probable SARS patients, 37 (94%) had traveled to mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Hanoi, or Toronto; one (3%) was a health-care worker (HCW) who provided care to a SARS patient, and one (3%) was a household contact of a SARS patient.

            "Full body : MMWR. 2003;52:405-411; 3 figures omitted; The Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH), with assistance from the World Health Organization (WHO), has been investigating an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This is a novel condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is characterized by both an atypical pneumonia and efficient nosocomial transmission. This report summarizes epidemiologic features of this outbreak in Singapore, including the influence of super spreaders* and the national prevention and control strategy.†; On March 6, 2003, MOH was notified about three persons who had traveled to Hong Kong during late February and were admitted during a 5-day period to local hospitals for pneumonia.1 These patients included Case 1 and a traveling companion. They had been guests at Hotel M (Kowloon, Hong Kong) on February 20 and 21, coinciding with the stay of a person with SARS who transmitted disease to at least 13 guests.2 On March 14, MOH was notified about six persons, including two health-care workers (HCWs), who were admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for atypical pneumonia; all had close contact with Case 1. Since late March, the outbreak has been characterized by nosocomial transmission caused by persons who were not immediately recognized as having SARS. The first major extension of this illness outside the health-care setting was from a recent probable SARS patient to two taxi drivers and the patient's coworkers in a wholesale market.\n",

            "Full body : ; DR REYNOLDS: Mrs W is a 65-year-old woman who recently switched to a commercial Medicare insurance plan and who presents for an urgent visit with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection [URI]. She works in the family business and lives with her husband; they have 3 grown children.; Because her new insurance plan did not cover her former physician, Mrs W made an appointment with a new physician in a large, university-affiliated group practice. Before her initial appointment, however, she became ill and requested an urgent visit. Seen the same day, she complained of 24 hours of sore throat, cough occasionally productive of small amounts of green sputum, and subjective fevers and chills. She also had mild shortness of breath, but no pleuritic chest pain. She had not taken her temperature at home. She denied ear pain, sinus pressure, headache, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She had been treating herself with fluids and acetaminophen. Her husband had similar symptoms the previous week and had been empirically treated with levofloxacin. Mrs W requested antibiotics because she hoped to feel well for a planned family party for her birthday, and because she wanted to avoid infecting her family, especially her pregnant daughter.\n",

The predominant viruses isolated this season have been influenza type A(H3N2) viruses that have been circulating in the United States for the last two influenza seasons and are well-matched to this season's vaccine. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during October 3, 1999-January 15, 2000.*; During October 3-January 15, the highest percentage of patient visits to U.S. sentinel physicians for influenza-like illness (ILI)† was 6% during the week ending January 1 (week 52). During that week, the percentage of patient visits for ILI was elevated above baseline levels (0-3%) in all nine regions. For the week ending January 15 (week 2), 4% of overall patient visits were for ILI.\n",

It is also established that communication between the central nervous system and the immune system occurs through bidirectional signals linking the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Psychological stressors affect the immune system by disrupting these networks. In this overview, we discuss the implications of psychological stress-associated immune modulation and risk for infectious disease.\n",

The researchers identified an infectious agent as the cause of 138 of the 200 cases. But rhinovirus, often considered the cause of colds, was present in only 105 of the cases. Coronavirus, influenza A virus, and respiratory syncytial virus also were identified as the cause of symptoms. Seven students had bacterial infections, and 6 had coinfections with viral and bacterial agents.\n",
